The project’s Agenda involves Analyzing the data using SQL on the SQL Server database.Tables are created in the database followed by data insertion into tables 
and exploration, i.e., noticing relationships between tables, walking through the columns, and seeing comments. 

**We keeps track of the following data fields:**

Records are displayed in an ordered manner, handling NULL values, and selecting records based on patterns like Wildcard, Operators, etc. Then working on Data Manipulation commands(DML) for Data Analysis.

Dataset Analysis is defined as manipulating or processing unstructured data or raw data to draw valuable insights and conclusions that will help derive critical decisions that will add some business value. The dataset analysis process is followed by organizing the dataset, transforming the dataset, visualizing the dataset, and finally modeling the dataset to derive predictions for solving the business problems, making informed decisions, and effectively planning for the future.
